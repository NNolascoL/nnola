# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer  I attended Antelope Valley Highschool. It was not the best highschool, there was constant fighting which I myself participating in. My first year there was actually a good experience. After covid hit it was not the same everybody was to them self, very little interactions. I honestly prefered math over english because it is less of a headache. The teachers I had for english were not so good compared to my math teachers. Math was always my favorite subject so I'd say math was easier and is easier than english still. I did the best in math because growing up as a kid math was always my favorite subject. I was in honors math programs during my middle school years.     
  
     


## Your computer and your and its capability?  
 For this class  you need a computer you can use at home.  So, what kind is it (windows, Apple, Linux)?  On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a total dummy (doesn't know a mouse from a keyboard) and 10 is a complete geek (knows computer stuff in and out) How do you rate yourself?  You also need to have have internet access. How is your connection to the internet where you live?

### my answer  I own my own personal computer. I built myself from ground up. it works pretty well but I dont have the best parts for it, but also not the worse. On a scale from 1 to 10 I'd say im a 10. I am very familiar with computers steming from my own experiences with my computer. I have internet access at home. It is not the best but it still gets the job done and helps do what I got to do. 
  
   

## Others and You?   
What name do you prefer to be called by your classmates and instructor, if your buddys call you something but you want people in the class to call you something else - what would that be? 

### my answer  Id just like to be called by my birth name. I dont really mind, I do have a nickname which is tony. Which ever is best I dont really care. 
  
   





## Aspirations?   
What do you want to achieve in life?  What college subject do you think would be of the greatest interest to you? What degree or certificate are you trying to achieve?

### my answer     I want to achieve wealth for myself. Get my self stable with a stable job and a steady income. Right now I am very interested in fire technology, I would like to be a fire paramedic, but start off as a wild land firefighter. I want to get my emt certification as well as my aa in fire technology. 
  
   
 




## Past adventures?  
Have you ever gone to foreign countries, if so which ones, if not Where might you go in the future?  Have you ever been in the military, if so which branch, if not which branch would you choose if you got drafted, and why?

### my answer     I have only been outside the country once in my life. This was when I was about four years old so I dont really count it because I was so little I dont remeber. I would love to go to japan because of the cars. I have always been a car head so japanese cars have always had my attention. Also just to visit and see how it is out there. I have not been in the military before. If I were to choose one branch I'd want to go the marines. If im going to the military Id want to be the best of the best so id want to go for the best. 
  
   





## Why are you taking Statistics?
Did you take Math 115 or Math 116 ?  Did you know Math 115 only satisfies a general education requirement but that Math 116 counts as taking statistics in several transfer institutions??  
What grade do you need to attain in stats to not upset your future plans, What is your plan?  
 

### my answer     This is my first time taking this math 115. I do have knowledge that math 115 only satisfies a general ed requirement but not for four year transfers. I do not plan on tranfering so I am okay with this class. I plan on getting a eighty percent or higher in this class. I plan on achieving this by turning in my assignments on time and not slack off.
